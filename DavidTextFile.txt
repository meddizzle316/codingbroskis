"It is not the critic who counts or the man who points out where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by blood and sweat and blood. Who knows the great devotions and in the end, knows the triump of high achievement or, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place will never be among those cold and weary souls who neither know victory nor defeat." Theodore Roosevelt, Man in the Arena
